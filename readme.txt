				WAR - SIMPLE CARD GAME

Objective
---------

To be the first person to have won all the cards! This may take a 
while, be prepared to last a long time.


Set-up
------

Shuffle the cards very well. Then the dealer makes two piles of cards
evenly distributing the cards. They offer their opponent a choice between decks. 
Whatever pile is left, is the dealer's draw pile.


How to Play
-----------

Each player should place their cards out at the same time in the 
center, starting with the top card on the deck. Whoever placed the larger card, 
may take both cards, and add them to the bottom of their pile. Aces are high. 
In the rare case that both players set down the same number, then a war begins. 
The players shout, "War!" and should then place one card faced down on top of 
the first card, and then a second card faced up. The cards that are face-up are 
the ones that matter. Whoever's card is larger, earns all the cards in the 
center. If those cards match, then the war continues with another set of one 
faced down and one faced up card. This continues until one player has won all 
the cards! The player with all the cards wins the game!
